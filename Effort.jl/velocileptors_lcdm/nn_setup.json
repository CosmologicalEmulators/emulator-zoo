The training dataset has been created by passing P_cb to velocileptors, assuming there is only one massive neutrino and a fixed redshift of 0.5. The AP effect is encoded in this emulator, with a fiducial cosmology with a single massive neutrino with a mass of 0.06 eV, a reduced hublle parameter of 0.6736, the baryon and cold dark matter energy density are, respectively, 0.02237 and 0.12.",
